    <p>Circuits may be my wands, and code my spells — but curiosity is the real magic I carry.
I’m Somya Upadhyay, born in New Delhi and currently pursuing Electronics & Communication Engineering at DSEU, GB Pant Okhla.

Instead of potion bottles, I tinker with ESP32 boards, sensors, and websites — turning ideas into working experiments, one project at a time.

When I’m not crafting with circuits, I’m strengthening my “defense against the dark arts” through journaling, meditation, and fitness.</p>
