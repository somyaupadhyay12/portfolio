      <p>Water Quality Testing System (Mahakumbh Project) (In Progress)

Developing a QR codeâ€“based water testing solution for large gatherings like Mahakumbh. A paper with QR code is placed at water points; when scanned, it provides real-time water quality info. If water is unsafe, the system guides users to the nearest safe-water booth. Currently refining data integration and user interface.</p>
